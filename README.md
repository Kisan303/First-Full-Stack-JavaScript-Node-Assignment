The User Management System is a web application designed to efficiently manage user data 
through a simple and intuitive interface. The application allows users to create, view, update, 
and delete user profiles. This system is built using Node.js with the Express framework, 
MongoDB for data storage, and Pug for templating. The core functionality of the system is 
centered around managing users and their personal details such as names, addresses, contact 
information, and additional notes.
